# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is focused on predicting stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. We aim to build a model that can make predictions on the future prices of a particular stock, which can be valuable for investors and traders.

## Data Collection

Explain where and how you collected the historical stock price data. Include any APIs, libraries, or sources you used. You can also provide sample code snippets for data retrieval.

## Data Preprocessing

Describe the steps you took to clean and preprocess the data. Include any data cleaning, handling missing values, and data scaling or normalization.

## Feature Engineering

Explain how you selected and engineered features for your model. Describe any technical indicators, statistical features, or external data sources used to enhance the dataset.

## Model Building

Detail the machine learning models and algorithms you used for stock price prediction. Explain the rationale behind your choice of models and how you trained them. Include code examples and hyperparameter tuning if applicable.

## Model Evaluation

Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of your models. Include metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Present the results of your model's performance on a test dataset.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your stock prediction model. Include code examples or a sample script for making predictions. Mention any dependencies and libraries required to run the code.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project if it's open-source. Include guidelines for submitting issues, proposing enhancements, or making code contributions.

## License

Specify the license under which your project is distributed. Include any relevant licensing information.

## Acknowledgments

Give credit to any external libraries, resources, or datasets you used in your project.

## Author

Provide information about the author or contributors of the project.
